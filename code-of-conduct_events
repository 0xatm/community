_This is the addendum to our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) for in-person events and gatherings._
## Events

In addition to the guidance above, please see the following process for IPFS-sponsored in-person events.

### Conflict Resolution

1. Initial Incident

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
    or have any other concerns, __and you feel comfortable speaking with
    the offender__, please inform the offender that they have affected you 
    negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the 
    accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by having 
    that initial discussion.
    
    IPFS recognizes that there are many reasons speaking directly to
    the offender may not be workable for you (including but not limited to
    unfamiliarity with the conference or its participants, [lack of spoons](http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/wpress/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/),
    and concerns for personal safety). If you don't feel comfortable 
    speaking directly with the offender for any reason, skip straight to 
    step 2.

2. Escalation 

    If the offender insists that they did not offend, if offender is
    actively harassing you, or if direct engagement is not a good option
    for you at this time, then you will need a third party to step in.

    If you are at a conference or other event, find the event organizer or
    staff person. How to identify an event organizer or staff person will be listed 
    clearly on individual event repos/webpages. Or, you can always email abuse@ipfs.io.

3. Wider community response to Incident:

    If incident results in corrective action, the community should support
    the decision made by the Help in Step 2 if they choose corrective action,
    like ending a talk early or banning from the event and other IPFS 
    communication channels, as well as support those harmed by the incident, 
    either publicly or privately (whatever individuals are comfortable with).

    If the Help in Step 2 run into issues implementing the CoC, then the
    Help should come to the community with these issues and the community
    should revise the CoC as they see fit.

    In Real Life people will have opinions about how the CoC is enforced.
    People will argue that a particular decision was unfair, and others will
    say that it didn't go far enough. We can't stop people having
    opinions, but what we could do here is have constructive discussions
    that lead to something tangible (affirmation of decision, change in CoC,
    modify decision, etc).

### Sanctions

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender,
expulsion from the IPFS event, or banning the offender from a chatroom, mailing list, or GitHub organization.

Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:

* warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports
will result in other sanctions
* requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical
proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
* early termination of a talk that violates the policy
* not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
* not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at
the event
* immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the
harasser holds requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future IPFS
events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
* banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a
certain time period)
* publishing an account of the harassment

IPFS event organizers will help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
safe for the duration of the event.

In the case of organized events, those responsible for the event should have readily available the following information:

* **Conference organizer:** [ORGANIZER NAME], [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[CONFERENCE HOTEL NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[MUNICIPALITY] Police Department**: [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[LOCAL SEXUAL ASSAULT/CRISIS LINE]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[TAXI COMPANY NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues,
conference-related social events, community gatherings, and online communication channels.

We value everyone's participation in the IPFS community, and will all
work to keep IPFS a safe and friendly space for all participants!
