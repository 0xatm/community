## Scope

We expect all members of the IPFS community to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all IPFS community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to IPFS affairs.

This policy covers the usage of IPFS public infrastructure, including the IPFS.io HTTP gateways, as well as other IPFS websites, IPFS related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of the IPFS community. It also
applies to behavior in the context of the IPFS Open Source project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, IRC channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of IPFS services.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the IPFS abuse team.

## Friendly Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: any behavior that threatens or demeans another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment; harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Media shared through public infrastructure run by the IPFS team must not contain illegal or infringing content. You should only publish content via IPFS public infrastructure if you have the right to do so. This includes complying with all software license agreements or other intellectual property restrictions. You will be solely responsible for any violation of laws or
othersâ€™ intellectual property rights.

## Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, please contact us at abuse@ipfs.io to send us an abuse report. If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

## Copyright Violations

We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. If you believe any content or other materials available through public IPFS infrastructure violates a copyright held by you and you would like to submit a notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other similar international law, you can submit a notice to our agent for service of notice to: abuse@ipfs.io

(We will add a physical mailing address here when we acquire one).

Please make sure your notice meets the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requirements.

## Consequences

All content published to public IPFS infrastructure is hosted at the sole discretion of the IPFS team.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the IPFS team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the IPFS team. We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

On IRC, let one of the ops know if you think that someone has transgressed against the Code of Conduct. If you would like to be an op and promise to help maintain and abide by the code, please let us know.

## Contact Info

Please contact abuse@ipfs.io if you need to report a problem or address a grievance related to an abuse report.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.

## Events

In addition to the guidance above, please see the following process for IPFS-sponsored in-person events.

### Conflict Resolution

1. Initial Incident

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
    or have any other concerns, __and you feel comfortable speaking with
    the offender__, please inform the offender that they have affected you 
    negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the 
    accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by having 
    that initial discussion.
    
    IPFS recognizes that there are many reasons speaking directly to
    the offender may not be workable for you (including but not limited to
    unfamiliarity with the conference or its participants, [lack of spoons](http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/wpress/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/),
    and concerns for personal safety). If you don't feel comfortable 
    speaking directly with the offender for any reason, skip straight to 
    step 2.

2. Escalation 

    If the offender insists that they did not offend, if offender is
    actively harassing you, or if direct engagement is not a good option
    for you at this time, then you will need a third party to step in.

    If you are at a conference or other event, find the event organizer or
    staff person. How to identify an event organizer or staff person will be listed 
    clearly on individual event repos/webpages. Or, you can always email abuse@ipfs.io.

3. Wider community response to Incident:

    If incident results in corrective action, the community should support
    the decision made by the Help in Step 2 if they choose corrective action,
    like ending a talk early or banning from the event and other IPFS 
    communication channels, as well as support those harmed by the incident, 
    either publicly or privately (whatever individuals are comfortable with).

    If the Help in Step 2 run into issues implementing the CoC, then the
    Help should come to the community with these issues and the community
    should revise the CoC as they see fit.

    In Real Life people will have opinions about how the CoC is enforced.
    People will argue that a particular decision was unfair, and others will
    say that it didn't go far enough. We can't stop people having
    opinions, but what we could do here is have constructive discussions
    that lead to something tangible (affirmation of decision, change in CoC,
    modify decision, etc).

### Sanctions

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender,
expulsion from the IPFS event, or banning the offender from a chatroom, mailing list, or GitHub organization.

Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:

* warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports
will result in other sanctions
* requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical
proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
* early termination of a talk that violates the policy
* not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
* not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at
the event
* immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the
harasser holds requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future IPFS
events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
* banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a
certain time period)
* publishing an account of the harassment

IPFS event organizers will help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
safe for the duration of the event.

In the case of organized events, those responsible for the event should have readily available the following information:

* **Conference organizer:** [ORGANIZER NAME], [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[CONFERENCE HOTEL NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[MUNICIPALITY] Police Department**: [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[LOCAL SEXUAL ASSAULT/CRISIS LINE]:** [PHONE NUMBER]
* **[TAXI COMPANY NAME]:** [PHONE NUMBER]

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues,
conference-related social events, community gatherings, and online communication channels.

We value everyone's participation in the IPFS community, and will all
work to keep IPFS a safe and friendly space for all participants!
