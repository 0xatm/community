# IPFS Information Ecosystem Audit

## Summary
We are undertaking an audit of the overall IPFS information ecosystem in Q1 2020. This directory within the `community` repo acts as a holding pen for working documents, artifacts and commentary related to this effort as we work to *intentionally design our community*: *where* people find us, *how* they interact with us in those places, and how those interactions can become more *consistent* and *systematic*.

## Methodology/framework
The overall framework for this audit focuses on examining the existing resources, needs and expectations, pain points, and potential delighters around three key pillars: **stakeholders**, **workstreams**, and **channels**.

### Stakeholders
Within the context of this audit, **a *stakeholder* is anyone with an interest or concern in IPFS.** Because we to some degree want IPFS to be synonymous with the decentralized Web in the long-term future, and because we hope that "the decentralized Web" becomes simply "the Web", this suggests that *everyone* will be a stakeholder of some sort at some point â€” at least until the dweb becomes as ubiquitous and invisible as running water or electricity. We can't boil the ocean to that degree within this audit, but we do wish to consider a wide variety of stakeholders, for example:
- Ordinary, dweb-curious folks who just want a basic idea of why the dweb is better than the web we have now
- Non-technical (or non-dweb-technical) business users who want to know how IPFS can further their wider goals, and who have the decision-making power to encourage or discourage adoption of IPFS among the developers and other technical users in their communities/businesses
- Developers and other technical users in direct interaction with IPFS; *note that this group contains a wide gamut of permutations and will need to be mapped out in more depth, some of which is outside the scope of this audit*

As part of OKRs (see below), this audit will define at a basic level our major stakeholder groups, as well as the channels they may be most likely to use and their importance/value to the IPFS project in the near-, medium-, and long-term.


### Workstreams
Within the context of this audit, a *workstream* is

### Channels
Within the context of this audit, **a *channel* is any location in which someone may be talking about IPFS *upon which we may have some degree of control or influence*.** For example ...
- A dinner party where someone mentions IPFS probably doesn't count as a channel (unless someone in the IPFS community is at the party!)
- An IPFS-related conversation between developers on Twitter counts as a channel *if* we have the resources to monitor for that conversation and a playbook in place for consistent, helpful ways to nudge our way into that conversation
- The ipfs.io website is without doubt a channel: We create and maintain the website, we have total control over the messaging, etc

As part of OKRs, this audit will discover and spell out currently existing channels, including the degree to which we *currently* have influence/control and the amount of effort/resource required to establish an optimal degree of influence/control.

## Q1 2019 Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)
**OBJECTIVE #1:**  Define the landscape of our existing information ecosystem.
- **Result #1:** We define at a basic level our major stakeholder groups, as well as the channels they may be most likely to use and their importance/value to the IPFS project in the near-, medium-, and long-term.
- **Result #2:** We discover and spell out currently existing channels, including the degree to which we *currently* have influence/control and the amount of effort/resource required to establish an optimal degree of influence/control.
- **Result #3:** We
**OBJECTIVE #2:**  Examine and evaluate this landscape for current and potential future effectiveness
**OBJECTIVE #3:**  Generate and rank recommendations for execution in Q2 and beyond
