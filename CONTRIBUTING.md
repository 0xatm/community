Welcome. Here at IPFS we are building the web of tomorrow. Right now too much of our data and files, and by extension our lives are siloed in Facebook, or Google's servers. At IPFS, we made it our mission create a world where data is decentralized and readily accessible.



Moving to a more distributed web is a big task and we need contributors of all skill levels and backgrounds.


Below are instructions on how to contribute to the IPFS project. What does it mean to contribute? Contributing means that you are helping with the coding, design, or writing the documentation of IPFS.
