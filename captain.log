> A Captain must keep his log, aye!

## Motivation

We've seen a lot of interest to contribute to the IPFS project from several individuals and although we make a best effort to be clear with the project roadmap, status and specs, the dimension and complexity can, sometimes, shy some of these people out. In order to mitigate this, we develop the **'captain.log'**, the one stop gist summary of what is going on, what are the current challenges and some direction to newcomers and current contributors on where the project could use some extra hands.

## Goals

- Let contributors and followers know the state of the project in a 2 min read gist
- Inform clearly to contributors and newcomers which of the areas could use some help and what is the degree of complexity of those

## What captain.log is not

- A exhaustive report
- Something that is super time consuming

## Examples

- js-ipfs https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/30
- js-libp2p https://github.com/diasdavid/js-libp2p/issues/6

## FAQ

- Is there a template? - Nope, just make it quick to reason about it
- How often should one write an entry? - In the most optimistic case, every week, but sometimes that is not possible if there hasn't been a lot of developments or simply the focus resides in the same issues
- Where should the captain.log live? - Inside a issue of the main entry point for that project so it is easy to get to it
