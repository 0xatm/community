It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

from the open source community.

### Community Improvement

The IPFS community requires maintenance of various "public infrastructure"
resources. These include documentation, github repositories, CI build bots,
and more. There is also helping new users with questions, spreading the
word about IPFS, and so on. Soon, we will be planning and running conferences.
