## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
TrueSight aims to be a decentralised oracle network built to provide moderation labels for user-generated content.

Typically content moderation is done in a centralised and opaque manner and may be unfairly influenced by stakeholders of the application.
By making over the blockchain applications are able to prove to users that moderation labels are generated by the impartial oracle network.
By off-loading storage of both the user-generated content and the moderation labels on IPFS and only storing the content hashes for both on the blockchain gas costs are significantly reduced.

## Project Status
<!--brainstorming, fundraising, under development, beta, shipped, etc-->
Prototype created as a submission to the Spring 2021 Chainlink Hackathon. Submission included a demo client application which makes requests to the protptye network. Project was awarded Runner Up. See https://devpost.com/software/truesight..

We have plans to take TrueSight further by working on a machine-learning powered aggregator for the oracle network which is trained by an ever-growing dataset of content with known labels. The dataset consists of content which has been manually validated by a group of independent moderators (who are compensated for their work) and is appended to with content causing the most contentious results from the aggregator.

The aggregator will teach itself to take a weighted vote from the nodes powering the network based on what gives results closest matching the training dataset. Every epoch (duration TBC) the aggregator is re-trained and the results are made transparent on a public ledger.
