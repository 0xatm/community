## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
TrueSight aims to be a decentralised oracle network built to provide moderation labels for user-generated content.

Typically content moderation is done in a centralised and opaque manner and may be unfairly influenced by stakeholders of the application.
By making over the blockchain applications are able to prove to users that moderation labels are generated by the impartial oracle network.
By off-loading storage of both the user-generated content and the moderation labels on IPFS and only storing the content hashes for both on the blockchain gas costs are significantly reduced.
