# Organizations

IPFS is one of a number of organizations used by the IPFS community on GitHub. Others include:


- [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p) - Modular peer-to-peer networking stack
- [multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats) - Self-describing protocols
- [ipld](https://github.com/ipld) - InterPlanetary Linked Data

We separate repositories out into multiple organizations because this helps the individual efforts be cohesive, and because not everything falls neatly under the IPFS umbrella.

All of these fall under the IPFS [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Transfer to organization process

Sometimes, we ask individuals if they would like to move their repositories over to one of our organizations. Authors maintain admin rights for their repositories, but the repo becomes part of a wider organization. This means both more relevant eyes on it, and better cross-repository issue tracking. The history of the repository isn't lost; what is gained is better branding.

This process goes like this:

- The organization administrator adds the repository author as a general member of the organization
- The author can then transfer their repository to the organization
- The admin must then:
  - Re-add the author as an admin of their particular repository
  - Edit the README to name the author as the "Maintainer" of the Repo (unless they don't want to be)
  - Edit the README to mention the organization's Code of Conduct
  - Let the maintainer know that they still control that repository, and can do whatever they want

Organizations administrators can add individuals to teams and give them admin rights to the repository, but this isn't necessary to transfer over a repo, and should be done sparingly for security reasons.
