> A Captain must keep his log, aye!

## Motivation

We've seen a lot of interest from community members to contribute to the IPFS project. Although we try our best to be clear regarding the project road-map, status and specs, the scope and complexity of IPFS can, sometimes, be overwhelming and scare newcomers. The **'captain.log.md'** file in any IPFS repository should mitigate this. The log is a short summary of what is going on and our the current challenges. It should provide some direction to newcomers and current contributors on where the project could use some extra hands.

## Goals

The Captain's Log should:

- Be aimed at contributors and newcomers;
- Consist of a quick, 2 minute gist;
- Describe the state of the project;
- Highlight areas which could use some help (and how complex or difficult those areas are to grasp)

The Captain's Log is not:

- An exhaustive report;
- Something that is super time consuming.

## Examples

- [js-libp2p](https://github.com/diasdavid/js-libp2p/issues/6)

## FAQ

#### Is there a template?

Nope, just make it quick to reason about it

### How often should one write an entry?

In the most optimistic case, every week, but sometimes that is not possible if there hasn't been a lot of developments or simply the focus resides in the same issues

#### Where should the captain.log live?

Inside a issue of the main entry point for that project so it is easy to get to it
