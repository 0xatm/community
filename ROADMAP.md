# Projects

## ProtoSchool

ProtoSchool is an entry point for people with little to no prior knowledge of decentralized technologies, 
blockchain, content addressing, etc.

Note: ProtoSchool is being bootstrapped in the IPFS Community WG but will eventually be spun out into 
its own project as it will tackle more than *just* IPFS.

* Milestone #1 (Q4 2018): [1.0 Release](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/proto.school/milestone/1)
* Milestone #2 (Q1 2019): Public Launch.
* Milestone #3 (Q1 2019): ProtoSchool Roadmap.
* Measuring Success:
  * Unique site visitors per month.
  * Average % completeness of each workshop.
  * \# of local chapters.

## Documentation Improvements

The Community WG is in the early research phase of how to best improve the documentation of IPFS. 
You can see and contribute to that conversation [here](https://github.com/ipfs/community/issues/367).

* Milestone #1 (Q1 2019): Documentation Roadmap

## Use Case Specific Quickstarts

The Community WG is planning to create starter kits which help people build on top of IPFS right away, 
like [Truffle Boxes](https://truffleframework.com/boxes).

* Milestone #1 (Q4 2018): [Identify first set of use cases](https://github.com/ipfs/community/issues/368).
* Measuring Success:
  * \# of uses of each quickstart.

## First Commit Events

These are in-person events designed to guide every participant through landing a pull request on IPFS.

The Community WG is in the early learning phase, documenting the key challenges of contributing to IPFS
by working through process by hand as well as running some early events in order to learn from the 
experience of the attendees.

If you have points of friction you've experienced contributing to IPFS please let us know 
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/community/issues/369).

* Milestone #1 (Q4 2018): Run one “First Commit” event and document learnings.

## Automated Workflow Enhancements

The Community WG is conducting a review of existing GitHub automation tools to consider
adding to the IPFS org. If there's some GitHub based automation you've used in the past
that you particularly liked please tell us about it [here](https://github.com/ipfs/community/issues/370).

* Milestone #1 (Q1 2019): Review existing Probot and GitHub Actions.

## Deploy to IPFS GitHub Automation

* Milestone #1 (Q4 2018): [Define project and dependencies for implementation in 2019](https://github.com/ipfs/community/issues/371).
